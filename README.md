Code Explanation:

OWI Robotic Arm:
  1. DH_equations, DH_complete_equations, and DH_complete_method are code files for implementing forward and inverse kinematics. 

XY Plotter:

  1. LMArrayandControlOriginal_Cylon.js is Cylon version for storing arrays in replication of robotic arms.
  
  2. LMArrayandControl for OWIandOther arms_j5.js is Johnny-Five version for storing arrays in replication of robotic arms.
  
  3. SpeedOnlyAlgorithm.js is our first algorithm of XY Plotter.

  4. SpeedPositionALgorithm.js is our second algorithm. 

  5. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is our third algorithm

  6. ModifiedBresenhamAlgorithm.js is our final algorithm.
