Final Report:

Team Thimble EE209AS Fall 2016 Final Project.compressed is our group's final report for this project.

Code Explanation:

OWI Robotic Arm:

  1. OWI_control_algorithm.js is the johnny-five library based code for conrolling the OWI robotic arm, including motor control and sampling control. This code was used to acquire the data displayed in the Movement About Different Axes Testing. 
  
  2. DH_equations.js, DH_complete_equations.js, and DH_complete_method.js are code files for implementing forward and inverse kinematics. 

XY Plotter:

  1. LMArrayandControlOriginal_Cylon.js is Cylon version for storing arrays in replication of robotic arms.
  
  2. LMArrayandControl for OWIandOther arms_j5.js is Johnny-Five version for storing arrays in replication of robotic arms.
  
  3. SpeedOnlyAlgorithm.js is our first algorithm of XY Plotter.

  4. SpeedPositionALgorithm.js is our second algorithm. 
  
  5. BresenhamMathAlgorithm.js is JavaScript code that implements the mathematical process of Bresenham's Line Based Algorithm. It is only to verify its functionality and operation. This code was used to predict and evaluate how it could be implemented with the XY Plotter.

  6. OriginalBresenhamAlgorithm.js is our third algorithm and initial attempt to implement the full version of Bresenham's Line Based Algorithm. 

  7. ModifiedBresenhamAlgorithm.js is our final algorithm.
